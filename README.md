# web design: Latitude Analysis Dashboard

https://stuhunter4.github.io/web-design_weather_data/WebVisualizations/index.html

The purpose here is to use HTML and CSS to create a shareable means of navigating the summary analysis for a given project.  This visualization dashboard website features four different plots for weather data.  Individual pages exist for each plot, containing a visualization and corresponding mock explanation.  Among the other pages are the landing page, another page which features a comparison of all the plots, and another page where the source data used to create each visual is in tabular form for viewing.
